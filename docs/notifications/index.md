# Notification System

The Ellithium framework includes a powerful **automated notification system** that sends test execution results via email and Slack, providing real-time feedback to your team.

## Overview

The notification system automatically integrates with your existing TestNG and Cucumber tests, sending comprehensive reports when:
- Tests complete execution
- Test failures occur
- Failure rate exceeds configured thresholds
- Specific test scenarios complete

## Key Features

### üìß Email Notifications
- **SMTP Integration**: Supports all major email providers (Gmail, Outlook, custom SMTP servers)
- **Rich HTML Reports**: Professional, mobile-responsive email templates with test summaries
- **Configurable Triggers**: Send notifications on test failures, completion, or when failure rate exceeds thresholds
- **Environment Variable Support**: Secure credential management using environment variables and GitHub secrets
- **Attachment Support**: Include test screenshots and detailed failure information

### üí¨ Slack Notifications
- **Webhook Integration**: Easy setup with Slack webhook URLs
- **Rich Message Formatting**: Structured messages with test statistics and failure details
- **Channel Targeting**: Send notifications to specific Slack channels
- **Custom Username**: Configurable bot username for notifications

### üöÄ Performance Optimized
- **Lazy Loading**: Only initializes when notifications are enabled
- **Early Exit**: Zero overhead when notifications are disabled
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Minimal memory and CPU usage
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Non-blocking notifications that don't affect test execution

### üìä Rich Reporting Features
- **Test Summary Tables**: Comprehensive test result statistics
- **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of success/failure rates
