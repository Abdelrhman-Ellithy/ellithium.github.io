# Notification System

The Ellithium framework includes a **notification system** that sends test execution results via email and Slack, providing feedback to your team.

## Overview

The notification system automatically integrates with your existing TestNG tests, sending reports when:
- Tests complete execution
- Test failures occur
- Failure rate exceeds configured thresholds

## Key Features

### ðŸ“§ Email Notifications
- **SMTP Integration**: Supports email providers through SMTP
- **HTML Reports**: Professional email templates with test summaries
- **Configurable Triggers**: Send notifications on test failures, completion, or when failure rate exceeds thresholds
- **Environment Variable Support**: Secure credential management using environment variables

### ðŸ’¬ Slack Notifications
- **Webhook Integration**: Setup with Slack webhook URLs
- **Message Formatting**: Structured messages with test statistics
- **Channel Targeting**: Send notifications to specific Slack channels
- **Custom Username**: Configurable bot username for notifications

### ðŸš€ Performance Features
- **Lazy Loading**: Only initializes when notifications are enabled
- **Early Exit**: Zero overhead when notifications are disabled
- **Error Handling**: Non-blocking notifications that don't affect test execution

## Quick Start

```properties
# Enable notifications globally
notification.enabled=true
